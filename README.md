# image-optimizer-web
This repository contains a simple web interface built with Flask that allows users to optimize images contained within a ZIP file. The tool extracts images (JPEG and PNG), optimizes them (with configurable JPEG quality and an option to convert PNG to JPEG when possible), and returns a downloadable ZIP file of the optimized images.
